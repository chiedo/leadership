# Leadership

Hey I'm Chiedo, ðŸ‘‹

What gets me excited about work is knowing my unqiue skillset is being leveraged, knowing I'm growing, and deeply believing that I'm improving the lives of others.

## My strengths

- Bias for action (double edged sword)
- Strategic vision
- Building relationships
- Direct / effective communication
- Entrepreneurial / business mindset

## My passions

- Time with family
- Exercise
- Watching Anime (Naruto, My Hero Academia), Marvel, Star Trek, and Star Wars 
- Studying (books, podcasts) and discussing tech, startups, innovation, history, finance, economics, governments, philosophy, and business.
- Advising, ideating, launching, and investing in startups

## Strong opinions I hold

- Org charts answer the question "who do I report to" but cross-functional squads answer the question "who is on my team"
- Meetings should be deeply engaging and if they are not they should have been an email
- It's better to be clear and uncertain than to be unclear
- If the team isn't aligned on what the most important goal is, the team isn't functioning like a team
- One person is the final decision maker (after consulting relevant parties) and who that person is needs to be clear

## My default leadership style

- Caring
- Being hands-off / high trust by default 
- Having strong opinions that are weakly held
- Morpheus to the people who report to me, not Neo

## What I Expect from Team Members

- Maintaining a high tempo (schedule the follow up meeting tomorrow not next week)
- Reducing scope
- Shipping usable progress often
- Staying engaged
- Holding peers accountable
- Writing things down (shared context and learning!)

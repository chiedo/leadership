# Leadership

Hey üëã I'm Chiedo,

I created this document as a reminder to myself to be the manager I strive to be and to have a set of expectations and standards you can hold me accountable to as we work together.

I view work as an opportunity for me to meet practical needs, express the skills I've been blessed with, improve the lives of other people, grow in my character, and build wealth so I can help others in need.

My job is to support you in whatever way I can, provide direct feedback to help you grow, and orchestrate the systems and processes that help our team be the best team we can possibly be while delivering the most impact to GitHub and our customers.

## Supporting You

- I care about the whole you.
- This job should add to your life, not detract from it.
- I default to being hands-off and trust your judgement.
- My opinions are one of the many opinions for you to consider but decisions are yours to make.
- Say the word and I'll be as hands-on as I can be.
- I'm only the middleman when you want me to be or when GitHub wants me to be.

## Providing Direct Feedback and Recognition

- I provide feedback and recognition constantly so we're always in lock-step as we work together.
- Feedback is always actionable so we can focus on how we might grow and move forward.

## Orchestrating Systems and Processes

- Optimize for async inclusivity by writing things down, keeping things discoverable, and keep things updated with others in mind
- Systems and processes exist to amplify our impact. When they hinder our work, we improve them or start over.
- Being able to go somewhere for an answer is ü•Ç. Having to ask someone for an answer is üê¢.
- Estimates are hard so they should be updated early and often! But when we break down work into smaller chunks, they're so much better.

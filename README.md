# Leadership

Hey I'm Chiedo, 👋

I'm motivated by challenges, learning, relationships, and winning.

I've got to be aligned and excited about the mission, the vision, and the brand.

And it's got to be good for humanity.

Selling snake oil? 👎 Selling vegetables? 👍

## My strengths

- Bias for action
- Strategic vision
- Buildings teams
- Leading asynchronous teams
- Being insanely likeable
- Community building
- Entrepreneurial mindset & experience

## My passions

- Time with family
- Exercise (But the kind you do in your thirties)
- Cooking
- Hosting refugee dinners and welcoming refugees to Harrisonburg with friends from church
- Watching Anime (Naruto, My Hero Academia, etc.), Marvel (less recently), Star Trek, and Star Wars 
- Studying and discussing tech, startups, innovation, history, finance, economics, governments, philosophy, and business.
- Advising, ideating, launching, and investing in startups

## Strong opinions I hold

- Org charts answer the question "who do I report to" but cross-functional squads answer the question "who is on my team"
- Meetings should be deeply engaging and if they are not they should have been an async
- It's better to be clear and uncertain than to be unclear
- If the team isn't aligned on what the most important goal is, the team isn't functioning like a team
- One person is the final decision maker (after consulting relevant parties) and who that person is needs to be clear

## My default leadership style

- The whole person first
- Being hands-off / high trust by default 
- Having strong opinions that are weakly held
- Morpheus to the people who report to me, not Neo

## What I Expect from Team Members

- Maintaining a high tempo (schedule the follow up meeting tomorrow not next week)
- Reducing scope
- Shipping usable progress often
- Holding peers accountable
- Writing things down (shared context and learning!)
